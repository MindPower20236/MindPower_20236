NOTICE
This repository contains the public FTC SDK for the CENTERSTAGE (2023-2024) competition season.
Welcome!
This GitHub repository contains the source code that is used to build an Android app to control a FIRST Tech Challenge competition robot. To use this SDK, download/clone the entire project to your local computer.
Requirements
To use this Android Studio project, you will need Android Studio 2021.2 (codename Chipmunk) or later.

To program your robot in Blocks or OnBot Java, you do not need Android Studio.
Getting Started
If you are new to robotics or new to the FIRST Tech Challenge, then you should consider reviewing the FTC Blocks Tutorial to get familiar with how to use the control system:

Even if you are an advanced Java programmer, it is helpful to start with the FTC Blocks tutorial, and then migrate to the OnBot Java Tool or to Android Studio afterwards.
